https://rileys17.github.io/8-Queens-Genetic-Alogorithm/

## Description
The 8 Queen Chess Problem is a problem to place 8 Queens on a chess board, in position where they are not interacting with one another.
Utilizes a genetic algorithm to gather solutions to this problem.
The user can change: 

 - the number of chromosomes (size of each population)
 - the mutation factor (the chance that a queen's position will be randomized)
 - the number of generations (how many iterations of the population)

While running, you are able to see the last solution found on the board, and can change which solution is viewed through the drop menu.
